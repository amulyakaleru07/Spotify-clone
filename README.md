# Spotify Clone 

This project is a non-functional replica of Spotify's website, designed to mimic the visual layout and styling of specific sections of Spotify's web player. It was created using HTML and CSS to focus on design and user interface elements. 

## Technologies Used
- HTML: For structuring the web pages.
- CSS: For styling and layout customization.


## Fonts and Icons
Since Spotify's proprietary fonts and icons could not be used, the following alternatives were implemented:  
- Fonts: Google Fonts were utilized to select a typeface similar to Spotify's interface.  
- Icons: FontAwesome's free icons and custom images were used to replicate Spotify's iconography.


## Features
This clone project includes the following elements:  
- Sidebar Navigation: Modeled after Spotify's web player's navigation panel.  
- Library Section: Includes customizable options to simulate Spotify's library interface.  
- Responsive Design: Optimized for different screen sizes to ensure adaptability.  
- Styled Cards: Designed to showcase music content attractively.  
- Footer Section: Includes a decorative line and additional design elements.
